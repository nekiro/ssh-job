## Examples

Authorize with ssh private key and execute some commands

```yml
- name: create-directory
  uses: nekiro/ssh-job@main
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
    user: ${{ secrets.USER }}
    command: |
      ls
      mkdir dir
```

It's possible to automatically pass github secrets to the shell script, it allows you to use provided secrets directly in the bash script.

In this example, we have few secrets for example `DIRECTORY`, we want to pass all of them to shell script, so we simply add `envs: ${{ toJson(secrets) }}` and use it as regular bash variable

Keep in mind action options are not exported by default, so you wont be able to access HOST, KEY etc.

```yml
- name: create-directory
  uses: nekiro/ssh-job@main
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
    key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
    user: ${{ secrets.USER }}
    envs: ${{ toJson(secrets) }}
    command: mkdir $DIRECTORY
```
